576 APPENDIX 1

in the opus Epistularum (H) of 1529; other passages³ are taken from
the Sponyiffi written in J uly 1523, and the notatoque Lucubmaeionung
(i) composed in January 1523. The resemblance to the originale is
very close, some sentences being embodied almost word for word.

The authenticity of the document has been doubted by Dr. J. B. Kan
of Rotterdam‚ in various Erasmiana published between 1877 and
18963 at first from inter-nal evidence, but afterwards from suspicion
of Merula’s character. He objecta that despite the quotations from
Erasmus' writings the style is not that of Erasmus; that it is not
a ‘compendium totius vitae’; and that there is inaccuracy in the
facts ⁰. The letter to Goclen he regards as genuine; and he supposed
at first that Merula had been imposed upon by some one who knew
his fancy sor autographa ⁷. Subsequently on discovering that Merula
was suspected of having forged some new fragments which appear
in his edition of Ennius, he attributed the forgery to Merula himself.
Dr. Kan’s arguments⁸ have been dealt wit-h by Prof. Fmin in his
Erasmiana⁹ and by Mr. Nichols. Merula’s character‘0 has been vindi-
cated by Prof. P. J . Blok ¹¹ and Dr. S. P. Haakn.

The controversy is too long to be discussed in detail here3 but
the consideratione of internal evidence, which seem to me to prove
conolusivelythe genuineness of the conspendiumn, maybe recapitulatod.
Mr. Nichols shows that Kan s arguments about style and incomplete·
neas are just what a forger would have anticipated and endeavoured
to meet. Only Erasmus could have ventured to write in a style
so unlike his own and to give a part when he had promised the
whole. The really decisivo point is the omission of Erasmus’
brother Peter, who as ‘Antonius’ plays so conspicuous a part in
the letter to Rome. This latter document was drawn up with great
care in order to obtain from Leo x a relaxation of Erasmus’ canonical
obligations, and the facts therein stated are presumably true in their
entirety; the obviously false names being substituted probably at
the time of publication. In this letter Peter, under the name of
Antonius, is mentioned frequently. The two brothers at first unite
to resist the attempt to force them into a monastery, but at length
Peter gives way; and Erasmus, contemplating his own ineffectual
struggles to escape the monastic net, writes bitterly of the defection.
of all this the only trace in the Compendium is the brief sentence:
