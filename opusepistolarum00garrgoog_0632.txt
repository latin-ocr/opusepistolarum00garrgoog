⁶94 APPENDIX VII

fortunately survives to throw light οιι the practice of Erasmus, and
doubtless of his contemporaries, in this matter, having found a liome,
after many vicissitudes, in the Athenaeum Library at Deventer.
'Phe care with which Erasmus usually preserved his writingsis
shown, however, by the address to his readers, added to the last col·
lection of letters published by him (M), from which ita appears that
shortly before he had examined the accumulatione of hispa pers aad
expected to find among them some of the writings of his youth still
811111ῖῖηιῑιῖεἰιιιιι8ιιβ’ first essay at publication was on his return to Basle in
August 1515. Finding that Froben had a miscellaneous volume (A)
in the presa, he took the opportunity to print with great amplifica-
tions three important letters, to which, for some unexplained reason,
he wished to assign corrected dates, and also an apology for the
Maria, which had recently been attacked with some ability by a
young professor at Louvain.

In the following year, while staying at Antwerp with his intimate
friend Peter Gilles, he had a small selection from his correspon-
dence, the Epi-‘stole ad Emsmum (B), printed, a preface being contri-
buted by Gilles, who represents himself as being responsible for the
publication. As the title implies, the greater part of the letters (four-
teen out of twenty-one) are by Erasmus’ friends3 and there is no
ostensible sign of his complicity, although to his intimatos he mado
no attempt to conceal it ⁹. It was natural enough for an autberto
assume modesty about the mei-its of his own compositions ¹⁰ and in
similar volumes of that period it is common to find an introductory
letter, apologizing with more or less fervour for the publication, and
attributing it to the pressure of friends.

'I'he next volume, the &stole aemes (G), divided about
equally between Erasmus and his correspondents, was also fathered
by Peter Gilles, who again assumes in his preface sole responsi·
bility. But a note²¹ from Rutger Roscius, who was correcting for
Martens’ presa, about a difficulty in one of the letters, makes it
quite clear that Erasmus had a hand in the publication; and the
book itself revealed ¹² that he was a guest in Gilles’ house not long
before the preface was written. In spite of this, Erasmus thought it
worth while to pretend some months later¹³ that the book had been
made up in hisp absence, and to protest a reluctanoe to its publica·
tion which he very possibly felt.

Agani, the editor of the Auctarium (D), Beatus Rhenanus, who was
Erasmus' trusted friend and loyal fellow·worker‚ represents himself
as privately culling some letters from Erasmus' sheaves of correspon-
dence and publishing them aster their writer’s departure for
Louvain. But, in fact, Erasmus had contemplated a new volume of
letters, and began making preparatione for it before he set out for
Basle ιιι the spring of 151812 He did not, however, actually super-
vise the printing; and in consequence some passages were included
which had afterwards to be excised.
