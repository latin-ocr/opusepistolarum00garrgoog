consisting mainly of elegant ep istles from Erasmus, the latter of his
more familiar correspondence and of letters and verses from his
friends. An examination of the letters printed by Erasmus enables
the period during which the letter· book was written to be determined
with accuracy. of the 53 letters contained in the three earliest
volumes of Erasmus' E pistles, Α, Β, and 0¹, published' ιιι August 1515,

these letters 168 are by Erasmus, 168 by his friends. The ‹12oe
17 July 1517 forms a sort of dividing line. Only one of Erasmus’
letters (LB. App .,81 dated 28 Sept 1516) falls before it; only 26 of
his friends’ letters are later. It is noticeable that 1118 4 letters
written before 1514 4all come from E ngland.

Altogether six, or perhaps five, hands can be distinguished m the

book. They may be arranged as follows:

1. Hand A, which covers ff. 93-204 continuously‚ except for a
letter written by Hand D on f. 93 80, evidently 18 a blank space,
and for f. 102, also written by Hand D, which 18 plainly out os
