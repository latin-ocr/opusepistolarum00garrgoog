Servatius.
⁴ Amongst individuale, in addition to those already mentioned,
my thanks are due primarily to Mr.1ng·ram Bywater, Regius
Professor of Greek in this University, who has given me most
genereus support and guidanoe, and who in reading through
all my proofs has allowed me to profit continually by lus
large store of learning3 to Mr. Robinson Ellis, Corpus Professor
of Latin, who has frequently aided me in traeing quotations
aud determining readings3 to Mr. G. Canum, Secretary to
the Clarendon Press, and Mr. Η. S. Milford‚ Assistant Seeretary,
for the most valuable practical assistan003 to Mr. R. L. Poole‚
