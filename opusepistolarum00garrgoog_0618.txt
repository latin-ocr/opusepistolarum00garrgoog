accord 3 and even the calculation suggested, that he was at Deventer
for about five years, is quite at vai-ianoe with the facts.

As Erasmus was a pupil of Regius, his departure from Deventer
cannot be placed earlier than Hegius’ advent as headmaster in 1483.
The date of this event hes been the subject of much controversy¹⁸
and is usually set much further bwk; but the year here assigned
may be accepted as correct. It is found in an anonymous life of
Agricola ¹· written in form of a letter to Melanchthon‚ by some one
who was present when with great emotion Hegius read out before
the school the letter announcing Agricola's death ¹⁰. Confirmation
for it is supplied by a letter of Agricola, in which he sends his
good wishes to Hegius for his projected opening of the school* at
Deventen but warns him that after the ravages of the plague by
which the town has been devastated he will find the school thinly
attended¹².'1*he letter has no date of mouth or year, but can be

placed with reasonable certainty in the autumn of 1483¹⁸. There
is also evidence to show that a few years earlier Regius was still
