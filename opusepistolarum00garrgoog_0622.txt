APPENDIX 111
THE LETTERS TO SERVATIUS, FRANOES, AND SASBOUD

11 is not clear whether these letters are to be regarded as genuine
documents or whether they are merely epistolary exercises on simple
themes, such as those exhibited in the De eonsen‘bendis Mis&

mterchsnged between Erasmus and his friends 101· the sake 01
practice in Latin composition. The latter interpretation 18 the
easier, but 11 they are taken as genuine, they may be divided into
two groups. They first, Epp. 4-9, shows Erasmus under the influence
01 a sentimental affection for Servatius, and pining 101· 1118 society,

life devoted himself to study and to the advancement of good learn-
ing. But there is 8 considerable resemblance in tone between these
letters and those to Grey at a later period (Epp. 58 etc), and 8 further
reason for regarding them as genuine may be found in Erasmus' admis-
sion made 111 later life 01 certain early indiscretions, ‘pvolu tatibus, etsi
quondam fui inclinatus, nunquam seruiui' 5the ihtention 01 ‘volup—
tates’ being made plain by the subsequent statement, ‘crapulam et
ebrietatem semper horrui fugiq ue'.’ It may be noticed that this
admission was made‘ m a letter to Servatius, from whom under the
circumstances concealment would be impossible ; that the letter was
never published by Erasmus3 and that when it appeared in print
a few years before his death, he endeavoured to disown it ³. There is
