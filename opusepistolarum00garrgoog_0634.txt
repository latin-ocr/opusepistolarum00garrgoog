consiste of four apologetice only, with the letter by which one of

them was provoked.
In 1509, 01 1110 request of Jerome Froben, Erasmus undertook a

new revision of the volume of letters, the opus Epi-volam (H), 1ο
which a great number of new ones were now added. He was still,
his 910ἱο00 tells us, averse from the publication, but nevertheless 110
took some care with the new edition, correcting it and dividingit
into books for convenience of reference. Friends had urged him
to arrange the letters in order of time ἰς but this 110 (1001111οἁ to do.
He was largely infiueneed, no doubt, by unwillingnees to spend
labour on a task which he regarded 00 of little 1109011000ος 1101
would he even arrange them according to subject, alleging as his
reason that so they would lose the 0110110 of variety. 11011010 were
to him elegant literature, not material for history. He consented,
however, to add dates and places 10 letters where they were missing,
so far as he could recall them. These additions are almost entirely
of year- -dates, and an examination of them shows conclusively that
his memory could not be relied ou. 001 of over 200 thus supplied
more than half are wrong, and in 1110 (10100 of his life before 1511
the proportion of correct ones is barely one-fourth.

After this there 10 0 change. A volume of letters, mostly recent,
appears almost every year, and if a preface is added, the protestatione
disappear. In the summer of 1531, when Erasmus was very busy
and worried about 0 new house, into which 110 had been forced w
move, he 00111 0 number of letters 10 Βο010 for Herwagen to print,
with the title lspistolae Floridac (J), but the editor shewed himself
lacking in discretion, and many passages were left in which Erasmus
would have wished suppressed. Accordingly he had the volume 10·
printed at Freiburg under his own eye in the following year. Five
letters and the preface were omitted, considerable expurgatione wem
made elsewhere, and new letters added. 'l'he title, Ερίεἰοῑαε Palaeo-

' naeoi (K), discloses the nature of the contente.

In ¹534 a few more were printed at the end of one of his treatises,
(L); and after his return to anle he went through his 909010, and
selected another handful for publication with a forthcoming volume
(M), which terminatos with an expostulatory 910ἶο00, complaining of
the liberties taken with his writings. In this he states that in his
latter years he had been less careful 1ο have his letters copied, a
statement which is corroborated by the composition of the volume,
where out of twenty letters only six are from his pen, in marked 0011·
11001 10 1110 volumes subsequent to the Epi-stole elevantes, in which tho
preponderance had always been the other way. But the correspon-
dence of his last years, which was published by him or his executore,
is altogether scanty, 111010 being only seventy- -two letters for the
years 1 32-6‚

In 11510 collected edition of Erasmus’ works, prepared by his
executore, the volume of letters was the first 10 appear (ΝΙ), 111
1538. It seems to have sold rapidly, for it was reprinted in 1541
(1⁴1²), and again in 1558 (Ν ). These three volumes are for the most
part substantially the same. All the earlier editions were reprinted
