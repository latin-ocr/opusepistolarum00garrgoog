[It ha· been assumed by all the biographer-e of Erasmus thet thia letter wa·
written after hia departure from Rome. Thia impliee either that Enamua, who
was certainly in Rome after receiving the offer from England (cf. Lond. xxvi. 34,
LB. 1175), paid no visit to Pieo before hie departure and only wrote to inform
him oi the step he had taken, or elee that Pieo waa absent from Rome when
Erasmus lert and returned to find him gone, of which there ia not the lent
indication in thia letter. A more probable explanation ie thet it wan written
when Erasmus wne still absent from Rome on hin joun-noy to Naplee with
Alexander Stewart, a Journey for which the principel evidence isin iv. exo-3, sup—
plemented by Ada9. 37¹⁴ and ⁴120- and 1.ond.iii. 44, LB. 233, and LB. App. 171,
aud the duration of which ia not npecifled. 'l'he third paragraph of thia letter
implica that Enemua hed not yet made up hie mind to accept Lord Hountjos'n
offex-3 ainee Piso would not have been hesitating what advice to give if Erasmus
had already started for England. Pom u absentem (1. 21) aleo suggest· that
Erasmus had left Rome for a time end was expected to τοῖαι-ιη not that he had
taken hie departure. Indeed, throughout the letter there is no note of fni-ewen.
It ia noticeable further that Piao epeake ot· answoring ‘serius' a letter from
Erasmus received ⁴ iampridem? As Ep. 21⁵ is dated 27 May, there cannot have
been a long interval between ite arrival in Rome and the writing or thie letter.

. The following may therefore be taken aa the chronoiogy or Erasmus mov-emente
