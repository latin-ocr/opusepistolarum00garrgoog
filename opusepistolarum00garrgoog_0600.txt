[This letter was never published by Erasmus, though copies of it were in
circulation before his death. Two manuscripts of lt exist, one in a xvi‘ hand.
in the Athenaeum Librury at Deventer (a), the other, written by Mai-tin Lypsiu
(1492-1555), in the Bibliotheque Royale at Brussels (β). There are also uim
printed versione of importance. Tw0 of these conta-in the letter only, on iou
quarto leaves, with the title Emami Buteo-adami Epistola qua ιο munet eur sunni

several copies are known, one being in the Bodleian (γ’). 'rho third was printed
by J. Lambert at Ghent in 1536 after Erasmus' death, with the title lpid-

The book contains nine miscellaneous speeches and letters, of dates ranginc
between 1508 and 1522. Four of tho letters are to and from Erasmus, one of the
latter being unpublished. β is also of high value and has the following imm
duction by Lypsius, which throws light on the manner in which the letter
became public property3 ‘Sequentem epistolam amiculi cuiusdam open vm
