viii PREFAGE

necessary to do more then trece fihe variants through the
sequence of edihions3 for experiment hes shown that it is
only very rarely that. a change is introduced into an inter-
mediate edition and removed in a leber one, and such changes
are either obvious errore or entirely negligible. The present
text is therefore nob an exact reproduetion of any one edition
but a conflation from all. In the matter of headings ω letzters
I have usually given that of the eerlieslz edition, with occa-
sional exceptions where an amplification was mede leben but
as the variatione of headings in different editions ere osten
considerable but unimportanfi, Ι have allowed myself more
freedom to neglect them in the critica-l notes than Ι have used
in dealing with the letbers themselves. Of the numerous
variations in the spelling of words I have noh attempted to
preserve any record, except in the case of proper names, where
differences of form are sometimes noted. Variations in order
also are discarded except on rare occasions where the sense
of the passage is affected. The dates are reproduced from
the earliest form with a minuteness which may perhaps
seem somewhab scrupulous; but Ι have wished the reader
to feel that in scrutinizing them he has before him the
precise details of the original.

In prepering this volume Ι have met with abundant} and
most ready help. 'Po many institutione I am indebted for
the loen of manuscripts. The Bodleian Library has shelbered
for me the great Deventer codex, which the kindness of
Dr. van Slee and the Oua-avom of sshe Athenaeum Library
at Devenber has enabled. me to examine at leisure undis-
turbed3 some manuscripts of Cornelius Gerard, lent from
the University Library ab Leiden through the friendship
of Dr. de Vries and Dr. Molhuysem and the important
manuscripts from the 'I'own Library of Gouda, whose velue
Dr. Kesper‚ Archim- to the town, enabled me bo recognize,
and of which his influence and that of Dr. van Ysendyk, the
Town Librarian, obmined for me the use. '1¹0 Dr. Hippe and
the Ourators of the Town Library of Breslau Ι owe the
permission to decipher and copy with my wife’s aid the
167 letters of the Codex Rehdigeranus 254 in a busy month
among Beatus Rhenanus’ books at Schhttstedst and bo the
eutherii-,ies of Trinity College, Dubfin, I owe the opportunity
to examine here in the Library of Corpus Christi College
