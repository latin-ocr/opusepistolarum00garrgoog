x PREFAGE

quent services in the librarios of Paris; to Signor B. Nogara
of Rome I owe the collation of some letters in the Vatican;
to M. Jules Finet, Archiviste of the Departement du Nord,
the copy of a document under his care at Lille; and to
Mr. W. F. Β.. Shilleto, reader to the Olarendon Press, most
diligent supervision of my proofs and constant benefit from
his knowledge of Latin literature Το these and many others
for help genereusly given Ι desire to express my cordial
thanks3 and above all should Ι make grateful mention of
the assistance that has been rendered to me within my own
family. My sister, Miss A. M. Allen, has often laid aside her
own work on Verona to copy or collate for me; and my wife,
besides executing many tedicus tasks, has continually aided
me in every way, and by reading through all the proofs with
unfailing care has saved the book from numerous blunders,
till even she can hardly be conscious of how much it owes
to her.

In conclusion, Ι would appeal for further aid in the
gethei-ing of unprinted letters to and from Erasmus. Ι have
printed below a list of manuscript letters which are known
to have been in existence recently, but of which Ι am unable
tro truce the originals. Any information which will enable
me to find them or which will bring to my notice letters
not known to me, or autographa of letters already printed,
Ι shall always most gratefully acknowledge.

P. S. ALLEN.
