there his first aetion was to obtain the promotion which he had
abandoned at Cambridge ⁷.

,In this connexion Erasmus’ proficiency in Greek may· be con— ¹
sidered. He had learnt the rudiments of it at Deventer¹¹3 but his
facilities for studying it cannot have been many, and whilst at Steyn
he still probably found it somewhat of an aohievement to write the
character, if we may judge from the fact that he headed one of his
odes with' Cornelius' name written' ιιι Greek. ⁹ In Paris he doubtlees
took what opportunities he could, and his letters as early as 1496 ¹⁰
show a tendeney to quote from t'he Greek. The motivoy which led
him in 1499 to decline Colet’s invitation ¹¹ to stay in Oxford and
lecture was probably that he could find none there to teach him
Greek. On returning to Paris he applied himself to the tongue with
all his energies¹², being convinoed of its importanoe¹³ and ready to
make any sacrifice for it. At Orleans in the autumn of 1500 he was
working hard at Homer, whom he still found some difficulty in
reading ¹¹ but on return ιο Paris in order ιο make better prognem
he proposes to hire a teaoher¹⁶ , presumably Hermonymua ιιι whom,
however, he was grievously disappointed¹⁰. In Epp. 143 and 149 his
studies are displayed' ιιι order to make due impression on a patron.
In the summer of 1501 he is clamouring t'or new Greek books, and
there is the first hint of translation¹. ¹⁷

His determination ¹⁸ was rewarded. By the time he reached
Louvain in 1502 he had become fluent in the tongue¹’. We hear
first of a Greek epigram ¹⁰, which was not, however, printed3 then
of translations from Libanius ¹¹ and Euripides” ς and he assimilatos
his name to a fancied Greek original²³. In 1504 he is ashamed of
the first edition of the Adayia, feeling them to be jejune, since
nothing has been culled from Greek autligors“, and· is convinced that
Greek' is necessary ιο all serious atudentsfl‘, especially ιιι ’111190103γῆ
During 1504 -5 he was teaching Greek to pupils at Paris, amonget
whom were Cop¹¹'¹ and Pyrrhus ‹1¹²⁸Anglebermeffind to this period
may be attributed his translation of the Odysseyffl In England he
could translate Euripides⁸⁴¹ and Lueian readily, though with some
difficulties in the latter case 11; but still he was not satisfied”. Το
