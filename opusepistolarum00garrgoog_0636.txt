doubt. The correspondence of Cornelius Gerard in No. 1323 men·
tions a number of small points ³² alluded to in the collection
published by Merula, and also supplies the exact complement to a
statement in one of the letters⁸⁸5 but as these are altogether too
petty to allow of the supposition that Merula had seen the Goudn
manuscripts and made use of some of their contente, the whole hypo-
thesis of forgery falls to the ground.

The contenta of 0¹ may therefore be accepted as genuine. The
fact that the collection made by Francis was not published by
Erasmus may readily be attributed to disappointment at finding
them inferior in style and contenta to his expectation. The tw0
letters of this period published in E were perhaps selected from it
as the only ones which, doubtless by revision, could be made worthy
οἱ Erasmus’ reputation.

Scriverius’ reprint of Merula’n book (0¹) contains thirty-four out of
the forty-two letters in Book 1, and adds to them a number of others,
most of which are letters to and from Pirckheimer. These are very
possibly derived from the recently published volume of Pirckheimer's
works (P): but as Scriverius omits some of those printed by Goldnst
and adds a new one addressed to Pirekheimer, it is possible that his
collection came from another source. He has also three new =letters,
addressed to John de Hondt.

The Epistulae Familiares (Q) were discovered in 1773 by the Bishop
of Basle in the records belonging to the Chapter, and deposited in the
University Library, where they are now· They were edited a few
years later by some one who conceals his name, but who was pro-
bably an official of the Library. The letters 'are all addressed to
Boniface Amerbach, and with two exceptione, one of 1515 and the
other of 1522, belong to the period of Erasmus’ sojourn in Freiburg,
1529-35.

The name of the editor of the great London volume of 1642
(Lond.) is not known; but ΜΓ. Nichols has shown³⁴ that there is
good reason for identifying him with a certain Adrian Vlacq ⁵⁵, a
Dutch bookseller resident in England, whose name appears on the
title-page in some copies of this edition. 'Phe text varies between the
Basle folios of 1538 (N2) and 1541 (N²); but the omission of the
letter to Loxanus mentioned above indicates Ν1 as the original used.
'rho editor follows the example there set of collecting the prefaoes,
cast in the form of epistles, from Erasmus’ other works3 and these.
with the letters published by Merula and Scriverius, make up two new
books and a half. But his work, though mainly collecting and re·
printing, was not entirely so 3 for a few dates are added, and the text
is occasionally corrected. As supplements to the London volume
were published at the same time collections of the letters of Melanch·
thou, More, and Vives, containing respectively five, one, and eighteen
letters to Erasmus.

Leclerc, in his great edition of the whole of Erasmus' works (LE),
was the first to attempt the chronological arrangement, which Erasmus
