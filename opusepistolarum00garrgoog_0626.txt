was ordained priest by David of Burgundy ¹, Bishop of Utoecht³3
if Beatus Rhenanus· is correct ιιι saying that he was already ordained
when he J‘oined the Bishop 'l'he first few months were fun of
happiness, in expectation of a visit to Italy, still the goal of classic-l
students, and his relations with the Bishop were most cordial‘z He
accompanied him ιο Ber-gen· op-Zoom, where the Bishop’s family
had a hereditary residence, and there made the acquaintance of
J ames Batt, who was secretary ιο the council of the town, and who
was destined ιο· be a true and valuable friend to him for the next
nilgmmfohnxzfllgfozded frequently with Steyn, and his letters made

into the form of a dialogus, the opening scene of which is doubtlsoe
drawn, according ιο Erasmus' frequent custom, from life. In it
Hei-man comes on a visit ιο Erasmus and meets Batt for the first
time, an incident which is possibly substantiated by the conversation
with Batt which Hermu records in Ep. 38. 'l'he scene is laid in
the spring, the Burgomaster and Town· physician come over from
Bergen to take part in the dialogus, their names, William Oonrad
and John· are mentioned, and facts of Batt' s previous life are given
in a way which imparts ιιι ιιι· of reality to the narrative.

Opmeer's statement that the journey to Rome was still ιιι contem-
plation when the Antibarbari was being compoeed is not to be
preffl5 for there is evidence to show that the disappointment had

come earlier. Herman' s 0de4 speaks of complaints from Erasmusw,
