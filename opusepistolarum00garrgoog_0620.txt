582 APPENDIX 11

In the year 1484 Deventer was again visited by the plague. Regius
writes to Agricola⁸⁸ on 17 Dec. (1484) that in the summer twenty
of his pupils had died of the disease and many had been driven away,
but that the school -had now recovered its numbers. This is clearly
the visitation which induced Erasmus’ father to 190911 1119 two boys
to Gouda3 his mother, however, probably fell 9 victim, 99 Κ911111191
suggests ⁸⁸, to the outbreak of 1483, since it seems that the boys did
not leave Deventer immediately after her death. On the question
of the date of his departure from Deventer Erasmus himself throws
some light in an 91191ν91·ω sent to a correspondent who claimed to
have been his contemporary in the school: ‘eum ego Dauentria
discederem, nondum fluuius qui vrbem praeterfluit ponte iunctus
erat.’ To illustrate this Revius¹¹ quotes a manuscript to show that
the bridge was begun on 1 Aug. 1482 and opened to traffic on
16 March 14833 and thus there is 911 obvious contradiction to the
date given above. But the care with which the town of Deventer
has cherished its archives enables the difficulty to be disposed of.
The accounts of the bridge contractor are 9111110 be seen preserved
in their original form on seventeen folio pages3 and they run from
15 June 1482 to 1487. It is clear, therefore, that the bridge must
have been opened 10 traffic before it was actually completed3 and
with work upon it still going on in 1484 Erasmus’ description of it
as unfinished is quite justified.

In the summer of 1484 Erasmus must have been nearly 9181119911,
if he was really born in 1466, an age at which he might well describe
himself as ‘iam satis maturus Academiae: since it was customary
then for boys 10 enter universities between the ages of thirteen and
sixteen ⁴⁸. It is remarkable too that if he had been nine years in the
school, he should 1101 have progressed beyond the third class ⁴⁸, even
allowing for the early inaptitude for learning 1ο which he 119191εῆ
An explanation may perhaps be found in the suggestion that the
residence as a chorister at Utrecht came 111 1119 middle of, instead of
preceding, his school time at Deventer. Nine is an early age for
a boy's singing-days 10 1)9 done; and such an interruption might
well have prevented him from reaching the top of the school.

Soon after Erasmus’ return home his father died, and for a
short time the two boys were engaged in a struggle with their
guardians, who in perhaps genuine zeal urged them 10 enter 9
monastery ⁴⁶. A compromisso was effected, and instead of being sent
as Erasmus wished to a university, they were allowed to continue
their studies at Hertogenbosch in another school conducted by the
